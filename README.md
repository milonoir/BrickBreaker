### My ancient BrickBreaker java game from 2011...

This is the original *unchanged* source code and NetBeans project files (and some build output in dist) of my Java BrickBreaker game I wrote in 2011 when I started learning Java. There are some Hungarian comments in the code.
This was a Java applet (?) which was a thing back then that enabled me to embed this Java game into my static HTML website.

I don't know if it's still working or not.
